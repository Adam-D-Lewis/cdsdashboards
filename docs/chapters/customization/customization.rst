Customization
-------------

Once initial setup is complete, there are further customizations you may want to make.

:ref:`options` covers settings of ContainDS Dashboards that change what users can see and do in JupyterHub. For example, you can 
hide the 'named servers' section on the home page, and restrict which 'presentation types' (frameworks such as Voila, Streamlit, etc.) 
that should be available for Dashboards.

:ref:`finetune` explores generic JupyterHub settings that may make sense now that you have non-technical users logging in. For example, 
launching straight into 'My Server' may not be the best landing page for those users.

:ref:`customlaunchers` is an advance topic explaining how you can add your own presentation types or adjust the way that the built-in 
presentation servers are launched.
