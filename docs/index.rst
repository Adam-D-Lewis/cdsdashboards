A Dashboard publishing solution for Data Science teams to share results with decision makers.

Run a private on-premise or cloud-based JupyterHub with extensions to instantly publish notebooks as user-friendly interactive 
dashboards to share with non-technical colleagues.

This open source package allows users to create interactive Jupyter notebooks that can be instantly and reliably published as 
secure interactive `Voila <https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ web apps. Any authorised JupyterHub user can view the dashboard.
